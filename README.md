# Sleep Stage Recognition
Sleep plays an extremely important role in both the physical and mental health of individuals. Monitoring and distinguishing between the two basic states of sleep and wakefulness can provide numerous benefits for improving sleep quality, diagnosing and treating sleep disorders, and supporting effective healthcare. Recognizing this importance, the topic "Monitoring Human States of Sleep and Wakefulness" has been proposed to research and develop an automated, accurate, and efficient sleep-wake state monitoring system.
This system has the potential for widespread application in various fields, including personal sleep management, healthcare for the elderly, children, and patients, ensuring security in homes, offices, public areas, and more. With the rapid development of sensor technology and signal processing, it is entirely feasible to monitor sleep-wake states accurately, efficiently, and cost-effectively.
This system promises to bring many practical benefits such as improving sleep quality, early detection of sleep disorders, supporting healthcare, and ensuring security. Researching and developing this topic contributes to enhancing the quality of life, protecting human health, and providing numerous benefits to the community.
